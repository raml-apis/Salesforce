The API notebooks are all executable! Hit "enter" in any code cell to execute it (and all cells before it that have not executed yet), or scroll to the bottom of the notebook and click "Play notebook". For more information, see [http://apinotebook.com](http://apinotebook.com).

#Considerations

- In order to run these notebooks you will need a SalesForce account. All the notebooks prompt you twice to authorize the client application to access to your account at some point of the excecution.
- You will also need to register a SalesForce application as described [here](https://help.salesforce.com/apex/HTViewHelpDoc?id=connected_app_create.htm). All the notebooks ask you for APP_ID and APP_SECRET in the very beginning.
- In order to test a method which retreives binary content you must have a document uploaded to your SalesForce account.
- In order to run the "Password" notebook you must register a user at your SalesForce account. You will be prompted to enter name of this user.
